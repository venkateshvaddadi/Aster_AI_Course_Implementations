This dataset contains thousands of validated OCT and Chest X-Ray images  described and analyzed in "Identifying Medical Diagnoses and Treatable Diseases by Image-Based Deep Learning". The images are split into a training set and a testing set of independent patients. Images are labeled as (disease)-(randomized patient ID)-(image number by this patient) and split into 4 directories: CNV, DME, DRUSEN, and NORMAL.
